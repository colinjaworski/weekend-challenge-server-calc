# Calculator assignment 

## Description

This project took me approximately 12 hours to do. Some of the problems I found to be challenging were sending and recieving info between the two javascript files as I didn't understand it completely, referencing the data that I was looking for to set up the equation, as well as the idea of creating variables for the buttons so that it would only use the last one pressed in the equation. Those things I spent the most amount of time on and needed a bit of outside influence.
